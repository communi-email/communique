# Content Moderation Policy for Communique

At Communique, we aim to provide a platform that facilitates constructive communication between individuals, communities, and decision-makers. This mission comes with the responsibility of ensuring that our platform is not used for any harmful activities, including harassment, threats, or hate speech.

To this end, Communique has put in place the following Content Moderation Policy:

## 1. Prohibited Content

Content that is explicitly prohibited includes, but is not limited to:

_a. Harassment and Bullying:_ We do not tolerate content that harasses or bullies individuals or groups in a way that is harmful or malicious. However, we recognize that not all discomforting speech constitutes harassment or bullying. Constructive political discourse, advocacy, and protest are vital aspects of free speech and are allowed on our platform. In this regard, content will be considered harassment or bullying if it involves targeted, repeated, and/or non-consensual aggression towards individuals or groups that is intended to degrade or harm.

_b. Hate Speech:_ We do not tolerate content that promotes or encourages hatred, discrimination, or violence against individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation.

_c. Defamatory Content:_ False or misleading content intended to harm an individual's or group's reputation is prohibited. However, this does not include critiques or criticisms that are part of broader, constructive conversations or debates.

_d. Violent or Graphic Content:_ Content that is shockingly violent or graphic, or intended to incite violence is prohibited. This does not include content that exposes issues related to violence and societal harm in an informative and respectful manner.

## 2. Content Reporting and Review

If you encounter content that violates our Content Moderation Policy, you can report it through the reporting mechanism available in our service. We will review the reported content and take appropriate action, which could include removal of the content and/or suspension or termination of the offending user's account.

## 3. Right to Remove Content

Communique reserves the right to remove any content that violates our policies or terms of service, as well as any content that is otherwise offensive or harmful. We may also suspend or terminate the accounts of users who violate these rules.

## 4. Changes to this Policy

We may revise this Content Moderification Policy from time to time. The most current version will always be on our website. If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify users via email and/or a prominent notice on Communique prior to the change becoming effective.
