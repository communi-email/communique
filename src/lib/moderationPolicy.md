# Content Moderation Policy for Communique

At Communique, we aim to provide a platform that facilitates constructive communication between individuals, communities, and decision-makers.

To this end, Communique has put in place the following Content Moderation Policy:

## 1. Prohibited Content

Content that is explicitly prohibited includes, but is not limited to:

a. Threatening or harassing content: Any content that threatens, harasses, or bullies individuals or groups is not allowed on Communique.

b. Hate Speech: We do not tolerate content that promotes or encourages hatred, discrimination or violence against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation.

c. Defamatory content: False or misleading content intended to harm an individual's or group's reputation is prohibited.

d. Violent or graphic content: Content that is shockingly violent or graphic, or intended to incite violence is prohibited.

## 2. Content Reporting and Review

If you encounter content that violates our Content Moderation Policy, you can report it through the reporting mechanism available in our service. We will review the reported content and take appropriate action, which could include removal of the content and/or suspension or termination of the offending user's account.

## 3. Right to Remove Content

Communique reserves the right to remove any content that violates our policies or terms of service, as well as any content that is otherwise offensive or harmful. We may also suspend or terminate the accounts of users who violate these rules.
